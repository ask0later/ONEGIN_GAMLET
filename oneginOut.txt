A COUCH FOR LUXURY AND DAMNED INCEST.
ACT I. SCENE I.
ACT II. SCENE I.
ADIEU, ADIEU, ADIEU! REMEMBER ME. EXIT.
A DOUBLE BLESSING IS A DOUBLE GRACE;
A FAULT AGAINST THE DEAD, A FAULT TO NATURE,
A FLOURISH OF TRUMPETS, AND TWO PIECES GO OFF.
AGAINST THE WHICH A MOIETY COMPETENT
AGAINST THY MOTHER AUGHT. LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN,
AGAINST YOURSELF. I KNOW YOU ARE NO TRUANT.
A GENTLEMAN, COURTIER.
A HEART UNFORTIFIED, A MIND IMPATIENT,
A LITTLE ERE THE MIGHTIEST JULIUS FELL,
A LITTLE MONTH, OR ERE THOSE SHOES WERE OLD
ALL. OUR DUTY TO YOUR HONOUR.
ALL MY SMOOTH BODY.
ALL SAWS OF BOOKS, ALL FORMS, ALL PRESSURES PAST
ALMOST TO JELLY WITH THE ACT OF FEAR,
AND, AS HE DRAINS HIS DRAUGHTS OF RHENISH DOWN,
AND, SISTER, AS THE WINDS GIVE BENEFIT
AND A MOST INSTANT TETTER BARK'D ABOUT,
AND AT THE SOUND IT SHRUNK IN HASTE AWAY
AND BID ME HOLD MY PEACE. I PRAY YOU ALL,
AND BORROWING DULLS THE EDGE OF HUSBANDRY.
AND BOW THEM TO YOUR GRACIOUS LEAVE AND PARDON.
AND CARRIAGE OF THE ARTICLE DESIGN'D,
AND CONVOY IS ASSISTANT, DO NOT SLEEP,
AND CURD, LIKE EAGER DROPPINGS INTO MILK,
AND DRAW YOU INTO MADNESS? THINK OF IT.
AND DULLER SHOULDST THOU BE THAN THE FAT WEED
AND EACH PARTICULAR HAIR TO STAND AN END
AND EVEN THE LIKE PRECURSE OF FIERCE EVENTS,
AND FOREIGN MART FOR IMPLEMENTS OF WAR;
AND FOR MY SOUL, WHAT CAN IT DO TO THAT,
AND FOR THE DAY CONFIN'D TO FAST IN FIRES,
AND GINS TO PALE HIS UNEFFECTUAL FIRE.
AND HEARS IT ROAR BENEATH.
AND I AM SICK AT HEART.
AND IN THE MORN AND LIQUID DEW OF YOUTH
AND IN THE PORCHES OF MY EARS DID POUR
AND IT MUST FOLLOW, AS THE NIGHT THE DAY,
AND I WITH THEM THE THIRD NIGHT KEPT THE WATCH;
AND KEEP YOU IN THE REAR OF YOUR AFFECTION,
AND LAY YOUR HANDS AGAIN UPON MY SWORD.
AND LET THINE EYE LOOK LIKE A FRIEND ON DENMARK.
AND LET US HEAR BERNARDO SPEAK OF THIS.
AND LET US ONCE AGAIN ASSAIL YOUR EARS,
AND LOSE YOUR VOICE. WHAT WOULDST THOU BEG, LAERTES,
AND MAKES EACH PETTY ARTIRE IN THIS BODY
AND MUCH OFFENCE TOO. TOUCHING THIS VISION HERE,
AND NOW, LAERTES, WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU?
AND NOW NO SOIL NOR CAUTEL DOTH BESMIRCH
AND OUR VAIN BLOWS MALICIOUS MOCKERY.
AND PREY ON GARBAGE.
AND PROLOGUE TO THE OMEN COMING ON,
AND RECKS NOT HIS OWN REDE.
AND SHALL I COUPLE HELL? HOLD, HOLD, MY HEART!
AND SO, WITHOUT MORE CIRCUMSTANCE AT ALL,
AND STILL YOUR FINGERS ON YOUR LIPS, I PRAY.
AND TERMS COMPULSATORY, THOSE FORESAID LANDS
AND THAT IN WAY OF CAUTION- I MUST TELL YOU
AND THE KING'S ROUSE THE HEAVEN SHALL BRUIT AGAIN,
AND THEN, THEY SAY, NO SPIRIT DARE STIR ABROAD,
AND THERE ASSUME SOME OTHER, HORRIBLE FORM
AND THEREFORE MUST HIS CHOICE BE CIRCUMSCRIB'D
AND THESE FEW PRECEPTS IN THY MEMORY
AND THEY IN FRANCE OF THE BEST RANK AND STATION
AND THY BEST GRACES SPEND IT AT THY WILL!
AND THY COMMANDMENT ALL ALONE SHALL LIVE
AND TO THE MANNER BORN, IT IS A CUSTOM
AND TO THOSE THORNS THAT IN HER BOSOM LODGE
AND VANISH'D FROM OUR SIGHT.
AND WE BESEECH YOU, BEND YOU TO REMAIN
AND WE DID THINK IT WRIT DOWN IN OUR DUTY
AND WHAT MAKE YOU FROM WITTENBERG, HORATIO?
AND WHATSOEVER ELSE SHALL HAP TO-NIGHT,
AND WHAT SO POOR A MAN AS HAMLET IS
AND WHY SUCH DAILY CAST OF BRAZEN CANNON
AND WILL NOT LET BELIEF TAKE HOLD OF HIM
AND WITH A LARGER TETHER MAY HE WALK
AND WITH A SUDDEN VIGOUR IT DOTH POSSET
AND WITH NO LESS NOBILITY OF LOVE
AND YOU, MY SINEWS, GROW NOT INSTANT OLD,
AND YOU ARE STAY'D FOR. THERE- MY BLESSING WITH THEE!
AND YOU YOURSELF SHALL KEEP THE KEY OF IT.

COSTLY THY HABIT AS THY PURSE CAN BUY,
CUT OFF EVEN IN THE BLOSSOMS OF MY SIN,
DAR'D TO THE COMBAT; IN WHICH OUR VALIANT HAMLET
DID COLDLY FURNISH FORTH THE MARRIAGE TABLES.
DID FORFEIT, WITH HIS LIFE, ALL THOSE HIS LANDS
DID SLAY THIS FORTINBRAS; WHO, BY A SEAL'D COMPACT,
DID SOMETIMES MARCH? BY HEAVEN I CHARGE THEE SPEAK!
DID SQUEAK AND GIBBER IN THE ROMAN STREETS;
DISASTERS IN THE SUN; AND THE MOIST STAR
DOES NOT DIVIDE THE SUNDAY FROM THE WEEK.
DO I IMPART TOWARD YOU. FOR YOUR INTENT
DO NOT AS SOME UNGRACIOUS PASTORS DO,
DO NOT BELIEVE HIS VOWS; FOR THEY ARE BROKERS,
DO NOT FOR EVER WITH THY VAILED LIDS
DOOM'D FOR A CERTAIN TERM TO WALK THE NIGHT,
DOTH ALL THE NOBLE SUBSTANCE OFTEN DOUT TO HIS OWN SCANDAL.
DOTH MAKE THE NIGHT JOINT-LABOURER WITH THE DAY?
DOTH WITH HIS LOFTY AND SHRILL-SOUNDING THROAT

DO YOU CONSENT WE SHALL ACQUAINT HIM WITH IT,

HYPERION TO A SATYR; SO LOVING TO MY MOTHER
I COULD A TALE UNFOLD WHOSE LIGHTEST WORD

I DO NOT SET MY LIFE AT A PIN'S FEE;
I DOUBT SOME FOUL PLAY. WOULD THE NIGHT WERE COME!
IF IT BE SO- AS SO 'TIS PUT ON ME,
IF SHE UNMASK HER BEAUTY TO THE MOON.
IF THERE BE ANY GOOD THING TO BE DONE,
IF THOU ART PRIVY TO THY COUNTRY'S FATE,
IF THOU DIDST EVER THY DEAR FATHER LOVE-
IF THOU HAST ANY SOUND, OR USE OF VOICE,
IF WITH TOO CREDENT EAR YOU LIST HIS SONGS,
IF YOU DO MEET HORATIO AND MARCELLUS,
IF YOU HAVE HITHERTO CONCEAL'D THIS SIGHT,
I HAVE SWORN'T.
I HOLD IT FIT THAT WE SHAKE HANDS AND PART;
I'LL CROSS IT, THOUGH IT BLAST ME. - STAY ILLUSION!
I'LL SPEAK TO IT, THOUGH HELL ITSELF SHOULD GAPE
I'LL VISIT YOU.
I'LL WIPE AWAY ALL TRIVIAL FOND RECORDS,
I MADE TO HER IN MARRIAGE, AND TO DECLINE
IMPORTING THE SURRENDER OF THOSE LANDS
IN DREADFUL SECRECY IMPART THEY DID,
IN EQUAL SCALE WEIGHING DELIGHT AND DOLE,
IN FILIAL OBLIGATION FOR SOME TERM
IN GOING BACK TO SCHOOL IN WITTENBERG,
IN HONOURABLE FASHION.
IN OBSTINATE CONDOLEMENT IS A COURSE
IN THE DEAD VAST AND MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
IN THE MOST HIGH AND PALMY STATE OF ROME,
IN THEWS AND BULK; BUT AS THIS TEMPLE WAXES,
IN THIS DISTRACTED GLOBE. REMEMBER THEE?
IN WHICH THE MAJESTY OF BURIED DENMARK
I PRAY THEE STAY WITH US, GO NOT TO WITTENBERG.
I SAY, AWAY! - GO ON. I'LL FOLLOW THEE.
IS BY A FORGED PROCESS OF MY DEATH
IS DEATH OF FATHERS, AND WHO STILL HATH CRIED,
I SHALL NOT LOOK UPON HIS LIKE AGAIN.
IS NOT THIS SOMETHING MORE THAN FANTASY?
I STAY TOO LONG. BUT HERE MY FATHER COMES.
IS THE MAIN MOTIVE OF OUR PREPARATIONS,
IT FITS YOUR WISDOM SO FAR TO BELIEVE IT
I THINK IT WAS TO SEE MY MOTHER'S WEDDING.
IT IS 'ADIEU, ADIEU! REMEMBER ME. '
IT IS AN HONEST GHOST, THAT LET ME TELL YOU.
IT IS MOST RETROGRADE TO OUR DESIRE;
IT IS NOT, NOR IT CANNOT COME TO GOOD.
IT LIFTED UP IT HEAD AND DID ADDRESS
ITSELF TO MOTION, LIKE AS IT WOULD SPEAK;
IT SHOWS A WILL MOST INCORRECT TO HEAVEN,
IT WAVES ME FORTH AGAIN. I'LL FOLLOW IT.
IT WAVES YOU TO A MORE REMOVED GROUND.
I WILL REQUITE YOUR LOVES. SO, FARE YOU WELL.
I WOULD NOT, IN PLAIN TERMS, FROM THIS TIME FORTH
KEEPS WASSAIL, AND THE SWAGG'RING UPSPRING REELS,

SO EXCELLENT A KING, THAT WAS TO THIS
SO FROWN'D HE ONCE WHEN, IN AN ANGRY PARLE,
SO GRACE AND MERCY AT YOUR MOST NEED HELP YOU,
SO HALLOW'D AND SO GRACIOUS IS THE TIME.

SUCH WAS THE VERY ARMOUR HE HAD ON
SWEAR.
SWEAR BY MY SWORD.
SWEAR BY MY SWORD.
TAINT NOT THY MIND, NOR LET THY SOUL CONTRIVE
TAKE EACH MAN'S CENSURE, BUT RESERVE THY JUDGMENT.
TAKE IT TO HEART? FIE! 'TIS A FAULT TO HEAVEN,
TAKEN TO WIFE; NOR HAVE WE HEREIN BARR'D
TH' EXTRAVAGANT AND ERRING SPIRIT HIES
TH' IMPERIAL JOINTRESS TO THIS WARLIKE STATE,
THAN A COMMAND TO PARLEY. FOR LORD HAMLET,
THAN ARE DREAMT OF IN YOUR PHILOSOPHY.
THAN IS THE THRONE OF DENMARK TO THY FATHER.
THAN I TO HERCULES. WITHIN A MONTH,
THAN MAY BE GIVEN YOU. IN FEW, OPHELIA,
THAN THAT WHICH DEAREST FATHER BEARS HIS SON
THAN THE MAIN VOICE OF DENMARK GOES WITHAL.
THAT, FOR SOME VICIOUS MOLE OF NATURE IN THEM,
THAT, IF AGAIN THIS APPARITION COME,
THAT ARE SO FORTIFIED AGAINST OUR STORY,
THAT BEETLES O'ER HIS BASE INTO THE SEA,
'THAT CAN DENOTE ME TRULY. THESE INDEED SEEM,
THAT EVER I WAS BORN TO SET IT RIGHT!
THAT FATHER LOST, LOST HIS, AND THE SURVIVOR BOUND
THAT GROWS TO SEED; THINGS RANK AND GROSS IN NATURE
THAT HATH A STOMACH IN'T; WHICH IS NO OTHER,
THAT HE MIGHT NOT BETEEM THE WINDS OF HEAVEN
THAT IT WENT HAND IN HAND EVEN WITH THE VOW
THAT I WILL SPEAK TO THEE. I'LL CALL THEE HAMLET,
THAT LOOKS SO MANY FADOMS TO THE SEA
THAT MAY TO THEE DO EASE, AND, RACE TO ME,
THAT ONE MAY SMILE, AND SMILE, AND BE A VILLAIN;
THAT ROTS ITSELF IN EASE ON LETHE WHARF,
THAT SHALL NOT BE MY OFFER, NOT THY ASKING?
THAT SWIFT AS QUICKSILVERR IT COURSES THROUGH
THAT THOU, DEAD CORSE, AGAIN IN COMPLETE STEEL,
THAT WAS AND IS THE QUESTION OF THESE WARS.
THAT WE WITH WISEST SORROW THINK ON HIM
THAT YOU, AT SUCH TIMES SEEING ME, NEVER SHALL,
THAT YOU HAVE TA'EN THESE TENDERS FOR TRUE PAY,
THAT YOU KNOW AUGHT OF ME- THIS IS NOT TO DO,
THAT YOUTH AND OBSERVATION COPIED THERE,
THAW, AND RESOLVE ITSELF INTO A DEW!
THE APPARITION COMES. I KNEW YOUR FATHER.
THE BELL THEN BEATING ONE-
THE BETTER TO BEGUILE. THIS IS FOR ALL:
THE BIRD OF DAWNING SINGETH ALL NIGHT LONG;
THE CANKER GALLS THE INFANTS OF THE SPRING
THE CHARIEST MAID IS PRODIGAL ENOUGH
THE COCK, THAT IS THE TRUMPET TO THE MORN,
THE COCK CROWS.
THE FORM OF PLAUSIVE MANNERS, THAT THESE MEN
THE GLOWWORM SHOWS THE MATIN TO BE NEAR
THE GRAVES STOOD TENANTLESS, AND THE SHEETED DEAD
THE HAND MORE INSTRUMENTAL TO THE MOUTH,
THE HEAD IS NOT MORE NATIVE TO THE HEART,
THE INWARD SERVICE OF THE MIND AND SOUL
THEIR VIRTUES ELSE- BE THEY AS PURE AS GRACE,
THE KETTLEDRUM AND TRUMPET THUS BRAY OUT
THE LEPEROUS DISTILMENT; WHOSE EFFECT
THE LISTS, AND FULL PROPORTIONS ARE ALL MADE
THE MEMORY BE GREEN, AND THAT IT US BEFITTED
THE NATURAL GATES AND ALLEYS OF THE BODY,
THE NIGHTS ARE WHOLESOME, THEN NO PLANETS STRIKE,
THEN WEIGH WHAT LOSS YOUR HONOUR MAY SUSTAIN
THE PERFUME AND SUPPLIANCE OF A MINUTE;
THE PITH AND MARROW OF OUR ATTRIBUTE.
THERE ARE MORE THINGS IN HEAVEN AND EARTH, HORATIO,
THEREFORE I HAVE ENTREATED HIM ALONG,
THEREFORE OUR SOMETIME SISTER, NOW OUR QUEEN,
THERETO PRICK'D ON BY A MOST EMULATE PRIDE,
THE RIVALS OF MY WATCH, BID THEM MAKE HASTE.
THE SAFETY AND HEALTH OF THIS WHOLE STATE,
THESE BUT THE TRAPPINGS AND THE SUITS OF WOE.
THESE HANDS ARE NOT MORE LIKE.
THE SERPENT THAT DID STING THY FATHER'S LIFE
THE SOURCE OF THIS OUR WATCH, AND THE CHIEF HEAD
THE THIN AND WHOLESOME BLOOD. SO DID IT MINE;
THE TIME IS OUT OF JOINT. O CURSED SPITE
THE TRAGEDY OF HAMLET, PRINCE OF DENMARK
THE TRIUMPH OF HIS PLEDGE.
THE VERY PLACE PUTS TOYS OF DESPERATION,
THE VIRTUE OF HIS WILL; BUT YOU MUST FEAR,
THE WILL OF MY MOST SEEMING-VIRTUOUS QUEEN.
THE WIND SITS IN THE SHOULDER OF YOUR SAIL,
THEY CLIP US DRUNKARDS AND WITH SWINISH PHRASE
[THEY SWEAR. ]
THIS ABOVE ALL- TO THINE OWN SELF BE TRUE,
THIS BODES SOME STRANGE ERUPTION TO OUR STATE.
THIS GENTLE AND UNFORC'D ACCORD OF HAMLET
THIS HEAVY-HEADED REVEL EAST AND WEST
THIS MARVEL TO YOU.
'THIS MUST BE SO. ' WE PRAY YOU THROW TO EARTH
THIS PRESENT OBJECT MADE PROBATION.
THIS SPIRIT, DUMB TO US, WILL SPEAK TO HIM.
THIS UNPREVAILING WOE, AND THINK OF US
THOSE FRIENDS THOU HAST, AND THEIR ADOPTION TRIED,
THOU CANST NOT THEN BE FALSE TO ANY MAN.
THOU COM'ST IN SUCH A QUESTIONABLE SHAPE
THOUGH ALL THE EARTH O'ERWHELM THEM, TO MEN'S EYES.
THOUGH LEWDNESS COURT IT IN A SHAPE OF HEAVEN,
THOU KNOW'ST 'TIS COMMON. ALL THAT LIVES MUST DIE,
THUS MUCH THE BUSINESS IS: WE HAVE HERE WRIT
THUS WAS I, SLEEPING, BY A BROTHER'S HAND
THY KNOTTED AND COMBINED LOCKS TO PART,
TILL THE FOUL CRIMES DONE IN MY DAYS OF NATURE
TILL THEN SIT STILL, MY SOUL. FOUL DEEDS WILL RISE,
'TIS GIVEN OUT THAT, SLEEPING IN MY ORCHARD,
'TIS NOT ALONE MY INKY CLOAK, GOOD MOTHER,
'TIS STRANGE.
'TIS TOLD ME HE HATH VERY OFT OF LATE
TO BEAR OUR HEARTS IN GRIEF, AND OUR WHOLE KINGDOM
TO BE CONTRACTED IN ONE BROW OF WOE,
TO BUSINESS WITH THE KING, MORE THAN THE SCOPE
TO CAST THEE UP AGAIN. WHAT MAY THIS MEAN
TO DO OBSEQUIOUS SORROW. BUT TO PERSEVER
TO EARS OF FLESH AND BLOOD. LIST, LIST, O, LIST!
TOGETHER WITH ALL FORMS, MOODS, SHAPES OF GRIEF,
TOGETHER WITH REMEMBRANCE OF OURSELVES.
TOGETHER WITH THAT FAIR AND WARLIKE FORM
TO GIVE THESE MOURNING DUTIES TO YOUR FATHER;
TO HIS CONFINE; AND OF THE TRUTH HEREIN
TO HIS UNMAST'RED IMPORTUNITY.
TO LET YOU KNOW OF IT.
TO MAKE IT TRUSTER OF YOUR OWN REPORT
TO NORWAY, UNCLE OF YOUNG FORTINBRAS,
TO OFFER IT THE SHOW OF VIOLENCE;
TOO OFT BEFORE THEIR BUTTONS BE DISCLOS'D,
TO OUR MOST VALIANT BROTHER. SO MUCH FOR HIM.
TO PRICK AND STING HER. FARE THEE WELL AT ONCE.
TO PUT AN ANTIC DISPOSITION ON),
TO REASON MOST ABSURD, WHOSE COMMON THEME
TO SHOW MY DUTY IN YOUR CORONATION,
TO TELL THE SECRETS OF MY PRISON HOUSE,
TO TELL US THIS.
TO THE INHERITANCE OF FORTINBRAS,
TO THOSE OF MINE!
TOUCHING THIS DREADED SIGHT, TWICE SEEN OF US.
TO WHAT I SHALL UNFOLD.
TO YOU ALONE.
TWO CLOWNS, GRAVEDIGGERS.
UNHOUS'LED, DISAPPOINTED, UNANEL'D,
UNMIX'D WITH BASER MATTER. YES, BY HEAVEN!
UNSIFTED IN SUCH PERILOUS CIRCUMSTANCE.
UNTO OUR CLIMATURE AND COUNTRYMEN.
UNTO THE VOICE AND YIELDING OF THAT BODY
UNTO YOUNG HAMLET; FOR, UPON MY LIFE,
UPON A FEARFUL SUMMONS. I HAVE HEARD
UPON A WRETCH WHOSE NATURAL GIFTS WERE POOR
UPON HIS WILL I SEAL'D MY HARD CONSENT.
UPON MY SECURE HOUR THY UNCLE STOLE,
UPON THE PLATFORM, 'TWIXT ELEVEN AND TWELVE,
UPON THE WITNESS OF THESE GENTLEMEN,
UPON WHOSE INFLUENCE NEPTUNE'S EMPIRE STANDS
VIRTUE ITSELF SCOPES NOT CALUMNIOUS STROKES.
VISIT HER FACE TOO ROUGHLY. HEAVEN AND EARTH!
VOLTEMAND, COURTIER.
WALKS O'ER THE DEW OF YON HIGH EASTWARD HILL.
WAS, AS YOU KNOW, BY FORTINBRAS OF NORWAY,
WAS GAGED BY OUR KING; WHICH HAD RETURN'D
WAS SICK ALMOST TO DOOMSDAY WITH ECLIPSE.
WE DO IT WRONG, BEING SO MAJESTICAL,
WELL MAY IT SORT THAT THIS PORTENTOUS FIGURE
WELL RATIFIED BY LAW AND HERALDRY,
WE'LL TEACH YOU TO DRINK DEEP ERE YOU DEPART.
WHAT, IS HORATIO THERE ?
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN, MY LORD?
WHAT I HAVE SAID TO YOU.
WHAT IS BETWEEN YOU? GIVE ME UP THE TRUTH.
WHAT MIGHT BE TOWARD, THAT THIS SWEATY HASTE
WHAT THINK YOU ON'T?
WHAT WE TWO NIGHTS HAVE SEEN.
WHAT WOULDST THOU HAVE, LAERTES?
WHEN HE TH' AMBITIOUS NORWAY COMBATED.
WHEN I TO SULPH'ROUS AND TORMENTING FLAMES
WHEN THE BLOOD BURNS, HOW PRODIGAL THE SOUL
WHEN YOND SAME STAR THAT'S WESTWARD FROM THE POLE
WHERE, AS THEY HAD DELIVER'D, BOTH IN TIME,
WHEREIN OUR SAVIOUR'S BIRTH IS CELEBRATED,
WHEREIN THE SPIRIT HELD HIS WONT TO WALK.
WHEREIN WE SAW THEE QUIETLY INURN'D,
WHERE NOW IT BURNS, MARCELLUS AND MYSELF,
WHEREOF HE IS THE HEAD. THEN IF HE SAYS HE LOVES YOU,
WHERE WE SHALL FIND HIM MOST CONVENIENTLY. EXEUNT.
WHETHER IN SEA OR FIRE, IN EARTH OR AIR,
WHICH ARE NOT STERLING. TENDER YOURSELF MORE DEARLY,
WHICH HAPPILY FOREKNOWING MAY AVOID,
WHICH HE STOOD SEIZ'D OF, TO THE CONQUEROR;
WHICH MIGHT DEPRIVE YOUR SOVEREIGNTY OF REASON
WHILES, LIKE A PUFF'D AND RECKLESS LIBERTINE,
WHO, IMPOTENT AND BEDRID, SCARCELY HEARS
WHO HATH RELIEV'D YOU?
WHO IS'T THAT CAN INFORM ME?
WHOSE IMAGE EVEN BUT NOW APPEAR'D TO US,
WHY SEEMS IT SO PARTICULAR WITH THEE?
WHY SHOULD WE IN OUR PEEVISH OPPOSITION
WHY SUCH IMPRESS OF SHIPWRIGHTS, WHOSE SORE TASK
WHY THIS SAME STRICT AND MOST OBSERVANT WATCH
WHY THY CANONIZ'D BONES, HEARSED IN DEATH,
WILL SATE ITSELF IN A CELESTIAL BED
WITH ALL MY IMPERFECTIONS ON MY HEAD.
WITH ALL MY LOVE I DO COMMEND ME TO YOU;
WITH ALMOST ALL THE HOLY VOWS OF HEAVEN.
WITH AN ATTENT EAR, TILL I MAY DELIVER
WITH AN AUSPICIOUS, AND A DROPPING EYE,
WITH ARMS ENCUMB'RED THUS, OR THIS HEAD-SHAKE,
WITHIN HIS TRUNCHEON'S LENGTH; WHILST THEY DISTILL'D
WITHIN THE BOOK AND VOLUME OF MY BRAIN,
WITH JUICE OF CURSED HEBONA IN A VIAL,
WITH MARTIAL STALK HATH HE GONE BY OUR WATCH.
WITH MIRTH IN FUNERAL, AND WITH DIRGE IN MARRIAGE,
WITHOUT MORE MOTIVE, INTO EVERY BRAIN
WITHOUT THE SENSIBLE AND TRUE AVOUCH
WITH SUCH DEXTERITY TO INCESTUOUS SHEETS!
WITH THIS AFFAIR ALONG. FOR ALL, OUR THANKS.
WITH THOUGHTS BEYOND THE REACHES OF OUR SOULS?
WITH US TO WATCH THE MINUTES OF THIS NIGHT,
WITH WHICH SHE FOLLOWED MY POOR FATHER'S BODY
WITH WITCHCRAFT OF HIS WIT, WITH TRAITOROUS GIFTS-
WOULD HARROW UP THY SOUL, FREEZE THY YOUNG BLOOD,
WOULD HAVE MOURN'D LONGER) MARRIED WITH MY UNCLE;
WOULD I HAD MET MY DEAREST FOE IN HEAVEN
WOULDST THOU NOT STIR IN THIS. NOW, HAMLET, HEAR.
YEA, FROM THE TABLE OF MY MEMORY
YES, FAITH, HEARTILY.
YET NOW I MUST CONFESS, THAT DUTY DONE,
YET SO FAR HATH DISCRETION FOUGHT WITH NATURE
YOU, AS YOUR BUSINESS AND DESIRES SHALL POINT YOU,
YOU, GOOD CORNELIUS, AND YOU, VOLTEMAND,
YOU ARE THE MOST IMMEDIATE TO OUR THRONE,
YOU CANNOT SPEAK OF REASON TO THE DANE
YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOURSELF SO CLEARLY
YOU MUST NOT TAKE FOR FIRE. FROM THIS TIME
YOUR BETTER WISDOMS, WHICH HAVE FREELY GONE
YOUR LEAVE AND FAVOUR TO RETURN TO FRANCE;
YOUTH TO ITSELF REBELS, THOUGH NONE ELSE NEAR.
YOU TOLD US OF SOME SUIT. WHAT IS'T, LAERTES?
